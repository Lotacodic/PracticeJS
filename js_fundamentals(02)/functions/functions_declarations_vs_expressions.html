        //This is a generic function: meaning that it can work for any function we give it
        //const age1 = calcAge1(1996);

       //const age2 = calcAge2(1998);

       /*
       Function Declaration can be called before they are defined but that can't work in Func Expression
       Uncomment line 15 and line 23 to test this
